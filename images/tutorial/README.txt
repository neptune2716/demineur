   - Highlight the left-click and right-click actions

2. using-numbers.png
   - Demonstrate how numbers indicate adjacent mines
   - Show an example of using a completed number to safely reveal nearby cells

3. 1-2-1-pattern.png
   - Visual example of the common 1-2-1 pattern and where mines are likely positioned

4. edge-pattern.png
   - Show how edge and corner positions provide more information

5. common-patterns.png
   - Collection of typical patterns players should recognize

6. advanced-analysis.png
   - Demonstrate overlapping constraints that help identify guaranteed safe or mine cells

Image formats:
- PNG format with transparent background preferred
- Dimensions: approximately 400-500px wide

- Add highlighting or arrows to emphasize key concepts

Place all images in the images/tutorial/ directory.
