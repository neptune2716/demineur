# Demineur

This project is a relaxing Minesweeper clone. Tests are written with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

## Running Tests

Install dependencies once:

```bash
npm install
```

Execute the test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

This runs Jest and reports the results for all files in the `tests/` directory.
